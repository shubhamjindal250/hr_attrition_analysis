📢 Impact & Key Insights (Story of the Dashboard)
The Finance department shows zero attrition, indicating strong job stability and effective retention practices that can be adopted across other departments.

Attrition in HR is observed only among female employees, suggesting the need for improved work-life balance policies and targeted support programs.

Only male employees have attrited from the IT department, reflecting high market demand and job mobility in IT roles, which increases retention risk.

The IT department has the highest number of employees, making it a critical area where even small attrition rates can significantly impact operations.

Employees aged 25–29 experience the highest attrition, highlighting early-career job switching and the need for clear growth and development paths.

Overall attrition is higher among male employees, driven by their greater representation in high-turnover departments such as IT and Sales.

The Sales department records the highest attrition, likely due to performance pressure and target-driven roles, impacting revenue continuity.

No attrition is seen in the 35–40 and 40–45 age groups, indicating strong retention among experienced employees and organizational stability.

✔ Overall Story of the Data

The data tells a clear story: attrition is concentrated among younger employees, high-pressure roles, and male-dominated departments. Meanwhile, experienced employees and structured departments demonstrate strong retention.
The insights highlight opportunities to improve retention through targeted career development, role-specific engagement, and demographic-aware HR policies.
